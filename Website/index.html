			<h3>Week 1 </h3>
			
				<p>The first week was a really good week. This is because it was the first week of freshers and the welcome week, therefore I didn't get up to much on my courses modules. </p>

			<h3>Week 2 </h3>
			
				<p> In week 2 I experienced my first lectures of my course, this was really exciting for me as i haven't done any computer studies before joining this university. I met all of my module tutors, where some classes were more interesting than others, I really enjoyed my web development lab class as I got to interact and start coding with HTML5 and by the end of that session I had a 3 page basic website. </p>
				<p> In this class I learned how to: </p>
				
				<ol>
				<li>Set up a folder for my websites on my Web (W:) workspace</li>
				<li>Link three web pages together with a navigation menu using a relative link</li>
				<li>Create links to external websites using an absolute link</li>
				<li>Use <code>h1</code> and <code>h2</code> tags</li>
				<li>Edit the page title</li>
				<li>Validate HTML using the W3C validator</li>
				</ol>

			<h3>Week 8 </h3>

			<h3>Week 11 </h3>
			
				<p> In week 11 I put my website through a html and css validator to find any errors in my code, the only remaining errors state that I have dublicate div IDs although these are meant to be dublicate as they share the same stylesheet options.</p>
